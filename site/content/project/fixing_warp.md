If you (or someone else) has stored plastic components in a hot enviorment, then you may discover they have warped. This is more likely to happen to the [Piston Plant Guide](https://roklink.net/part/piston-plant-guide), due to how thin it is. 

Thankfully fixing this is fairly simple and dosen't require any special tools or knowledge.

First, get a pot large enough that you can fit the part inside of flat.

After a bit of playing I learned that the direction of the rubber seal matters. Somehow the seal had gotten flipped around by the previous owner, possibly by moving the down-a-vator platform around with too much force.

The following image shows the proper seal orientation. The image makes it look tighter than it actually was.

Once the seal had been flipped around and re-installed in the piston casing the down-a-vator works like new! A [quick video clip ](https://photos.app.goo.gl/gRfB3QQhjh13j6AWA)showing the repaired down-a-vator.

Hopefully that helps other fix their vintage Rokenbok Down-A-Vators.
