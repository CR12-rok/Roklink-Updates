If you (or someone else) has stored plastic components in a hot enviorment, then you may discover they have warped. This is more likely to happen to the [Piston Plant Guide](https://roklink.net/part/piston-plant-guide), due to how thin it is. 

Thankfully fixing this is fairly simple and dosen't require any special tools or knowledge.

Obviously, don't do this with any electronic parts, and hot water is hot.

Essentially, your going to do the same thing that created the warp in the first place. 

First, get a pot large enough that you can fit the part inside of it flat.

Fill the pot with just enough water to cover the part, and remove it. 

Wait for the water to come to a very low boil. Using a utensil, and your hand (preferably with a mitt on so you don't burn yourself), or another utensil, press the part down so it is flat against the bottom of the pot. Hold it for a minute or so, being careful not to snap it. Repeat as needed.

Afterwards, remove the part and let it cool off for a minute. Dry with a towel. 

It is unlikely that you will get a perfect result, especially if the plastic is cracked like mine, but you should be able to get it fairly close to it's original form.
