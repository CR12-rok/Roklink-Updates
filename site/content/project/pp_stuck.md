As the [Piston Plant](https://roklink.net/set/piston-plant-1999/) gets older, you may find that it gets stuck and/or becomes squeaky over time. Fear not! This is an easy fix. All you need is [White Lithium Grease](https://www.lowes.com/pd/Blaster-White-Lithium-Grease/50337278).

First, remove the swing arm.

Second, your going to need to remove all the screws from the underside. A few are hidden on the sides. Be sure to use a small screw driver, because the screws will strip easily if your mean to them.

Remove the long shaft that runs down the center. Apply grease where it makes contact with the plastic shell. Also apply some to the wheels. This is also a good oppertunity to clean up whatever garbage has made it's way inside of the assembly.

You can also remove the wheel and grease it too, while your at it.

Finally, re-install all the pistons. They are different! The two with fins obviously go into the slots with fin cut outs. Pay special attention that the piston with a yellow tab lines up with the tab on the main assembly. The final piston must have the side with the solid plastic wall facing outward!
