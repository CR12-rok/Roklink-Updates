After a long time in storage, I pulled out the vintage Rokenbok set only to find the RC Monorail was having trouble moving.

Upon closer inspection, it seemed the drive rollers under the monorail engine were very easy to stall. It just didn't have any torque.

Out came the screw driver, 1, 2, 3, ...8, 9, 10 screws hold the outer casing together then another couple to get at the gearbox. Once the gearbox was open the issue was plain as day:

A tiny dab of J-B Weld PlasticWeld epoxy, 10 minutes and she's good as new. Back to climbing the trak and delivering the Roks.
