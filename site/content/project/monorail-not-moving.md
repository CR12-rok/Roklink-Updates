After a long time in storage, I pulled out the vintage Rokenbok set only to find the RC Monorail was having trouble moving.

Upon closer inspection, it seemed the drive rollers under the monorail engine were very easy to stall. It just didn't have any torque.

Out came the screw driver, 1, 2, 3, ...8, 9, 10 screws hold the outer casing together, note that a few are hidden under this removable blue piece. You do not need to remove the screws for the rollers.

Then another couple to get at the gearbox. Once the gearbox was open the issue was plain as day:

A tiny dab of J-B Weld PlasticWeld epoxy, 10 minutes and she's good as new. Alternatively, you can buy a new gear by [clicking here.](https://www.ebay.com/itm/283473725664)

If you have one, you may also wish to add a small washer to keep the gear from slipping out of place.

Finally, when your putting it back together, make sure to not snag the small gray cable, and insert the blue pin into the hole in the circuit board.

Back to climbing the trak and delivering the Roks!
