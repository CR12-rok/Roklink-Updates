Monorail Mania Complete Action Set Launch your Rokenbok world with the exciting, futuristic Monorail Mania Complete Action Set!

Includes two interactive machines: Monorail with Power Dump Bed, and Automatic Conveyor.
Our easiest vehicle to drive, but advanced levels of function and challenge too.
Includes rail crossing, two loading docks, and sorting chute system.
Lifetime Guarantee on ROK Star Controller and Rokenbok building pieces.
This modern twist on a beloved classic brings a whole new level of fun to your family. Your little engineer will delight in taking control of the Monorail's power dump bed that moves from side to side for easy loading and unloading action.

Haul and dump your payload of ROK Balls onto the automatic conveyor and watch as the balls are automatically lifted on the conveyor belt. You'll be amazed as they are then sorted by size and color before being stored in spring-loaded dumping bins to await your next pick up.

The dynamic Monorail Mania Complete Action Set can either serve as a starting point for your new Rokenbok world or can be an awesome addition to your existing Rokenbok collection. This set comes with nearly 8 feet of track assembled from standard Rokenbok building pieces making it easy to expand and add switches and crossings too!

Rokenbok's Monorail Mania Complete Action Set includes: Monorail with Power Dump Bed, ROK Star Controller, Automatic Conveyor, Monorail Crossing, Sorting Chute System, Two Loading Docks, Detailed Plan Sheet with building instructions and over 77 building pieces.

A- Yes, you control which way the dump bed moves from the ROK Star Controller.

Q- Do I need to buy special track for the Monorail?
A- No, tracks are made from standard Rokenbok building pieces, and with this combinations set, you have enough to build the layout shown in the images above. However, adding more Monorail Track will only allow you more freedom to build even more elaborate layouts.

Q- Is ROK Star compatible with Rokenbok RC controllers?
