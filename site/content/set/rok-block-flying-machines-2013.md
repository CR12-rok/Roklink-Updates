Flying Machines

Ready for takeoff. Quick! Launch your Rescue Helicopter into the air, someone's in need! Spin the rotors! It looks like we're about to hit some turbulence- get ready for a bumpy ride. From the cockpit you'll have the perfect birds-eye view of everything. When you're finished with your mission, rebuild your helicopter into your own Swept Wing Jet. It's time to take off. You rule the sky!

Your Flying Machines set comes with building plans to build either a Swept Wing Jet or a Helicopter. Plus, all parts can be stored in the included durable clear storage bin - clean up made simple.

ROK Blocks are designed to teach children how to assemble their own creations, keeping kids busy for hours with creative fun. Plus, all ROK Blocks are compatible with Rokenbok building pieces so this is only the beginning. The adventure continues as you expand sets and open up new possibilities.

Key Concepts:

Children learn mathematical correspondences, how to re-purpose material, using simple machines, and different ways building pieces can be connected together. . .  playing with ROK Blocks builds affinity for STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, arts, and math).

This action packed book comes with over 20 awesome build ideas and the step-by-step instructions to build both the Swept Wing Airplane and the Helicopter, and many more ROK Block creations (additional parts required).
