title: Pump Station Start Set
year: 1999
description: >-
  Scoop up balls into your Skip Track and drive up to the hopper. Now with a simple bump and dump...drop your load, and be on your way. It's that easy! And that's only the beginning. Now, race through the piston arm and watch how cool it is to send balls up, down and around the plant until they slide into the quarry. Designed with multiple skill levels in-mind, maximum play value, and family time fun, even the youngest of Rokenbokers will be captivated by this world of imaginary play. Great for children ages 5 and up. Comes with 88 pieces including a Command Deck, one Control Pad, and a Skip Track vehicle. Includes 110 Volt A/C adapter and three AA batteries.
