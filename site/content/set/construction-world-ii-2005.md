This huge 400 piece building set has all the latest Rokenbok building components: ROK’N Roadways; S beams; curved beams; Super Slides. . . plus all the building basics like: beams and blocks; chutes and hoppers; roofs; braces, and a lot more. There is even the Rokenbok Water Tower, a super cool way to collect and guide ROKs all over the place! Construction World II includes plans to build either one of the two giant buildings shown here; the amazing Ball Factory and the Road & Rail Bridge. But you can build anything you want, and you’ll find everything you need in the all new Construction World II!

## Common Questions
Q- I am trying to decide which large building set to buy; Architect's Dream, Inventor's Tool Box, or Construction World II?    
A- Construction World II is a good choice for a general building set with a broad range of Rokenbok construction pieces.  The Inventor's tool box is great for more challenging building with angels and articulating features.  Architect's Dream is best for creating lots of architectural detail.
