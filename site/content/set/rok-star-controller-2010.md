**Please note: The ROK Star Controller will not control Rokenbok Classic RC (radio controlled) machines.**

ROK Star is wireless, multi-player, multi-vehicle remote control.  The ROK Star Controller not only lets you control any number of Rokenbok machines, it lets you switch on the go.  Just point and control.  What’s more, everyone can play.  Add as many ROK Star controllers and Rokenbok machines as you want.  Designed to be easy enough for a preschooler and yet appeal to our most advanced Rokenbokers, ROK Star is at the heart of Rokenbok interactive play.

ROK Star is a unique, patent pending technology.  To make the system easy and intuitive, we combined broad and narrow beam IR and visible light transmitters, invented new reflective optical filtering, and built a proprietary microprocessor based control system.  The result is something the world has never seen before.

Press and hold the Select button, then aim the red light beam at any ROK Star machine. That machine is now in your control!  Use the large directional wheel to move the machine around your Rokenbok world.  Additional functions, like lifting or dumping, are performed by pressing the A, B, X, or Y function buttons.

Here are some other ROK Star features:
  - Toggle a siren on or off.
  - Operate a horn and flash lights.
  - Change the pitch of the horn.
  - Slow the speed of machines for precise maneuvering.
  - Put machines in cruise control mode.
  - Sound a back-up warning.

Requires 3 AA batteries (not included).

## Rok Star Technology
ROK Star is a completely wireless, light-based, multi-player, multi-vehicle remote control system.  This new control system allows an unlimited number of controllers to talk to an unlimited number of Rokenbok machines simultaneously. Key to ROK Star technology are high-speed data bursts transmitted by infrared light. It's this unique new data  transmission architecture that allows multiple controllers to be used at the same time.

The ROK Star controller uses a combination of visible and infrared light to select a vehicle and give it a unique address.  Once the ROK Star Controller selects a vehicle to control, the controller and vehicle are paired and the vehicle will ignore data transmitted by all other controllers.  It's like cupping your hands over your mouth and yelling "Hey you!" to a playmate across a crowded playground.

Another key issue is the interference from fluorescent lights that often raises havoc with infrared based control systems.  A unique optical filtering system was designed that rejects overhead interference from florescent lighting while allowing the high-speed data  bursts from the ROK Star controllers to pass into vehicle receivers unimpeded.

The result is well designed, premium quality remote control toys that are both fun and highly functional.  The new ROK Star design is more intuitive than Rokenbok's retiring RF based system, and most users will have it up and running right away, without the need to even reference instructions.  Just point a controller at a vehicle and press the select button, now you are in control!  No switches to set, no addresses to remember - just point, click and it works.
