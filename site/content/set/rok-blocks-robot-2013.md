ROKBot Robot Ready For Action!

Robots are all the buzz these days and are an important installment in our modern day society. While having your child program their own robot might not be a reality (at the moment), get them started with building ROK Block Robots! Tap into their creativity and build your own storyline around your new robot. Does your ROKBot fight evil or destroy the town?

This set comes with the plans to build 2 separate robots, but we'd also encourage you to experiment and come up with your own designs, too! Plus all parts can be stored in the included durable, clear storage bin - making clean-up simple.

ROK Blocks are designed to teach children how to assemble their own creations, keeping kids busy for hours with creative fun. Plus all ROK Blocks are compatible with Rokenbok building pieces, so this is only the beginning. The adventure continues as you expand sets and open up new possibilities.

Key Concepts:

Children learn mathematical correspondences, how to re-purpose material, simple machines, and different ways building pieces can be connected together. Playing with ROK Blocks builds affinity for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math).
