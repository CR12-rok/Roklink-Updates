description: >-
  ROK’n Roadways is a whole new way to build with Rokenbok. The new Roadways building pieces are self supporting, requiring many fewer beams and blocks to build a road or bridge. Build the coolest highways, causeways, or suspension bridge. Now you can build bigger, better Rokenbok buildings with a lot fewer pieces! Check out the roadway elements.

Build Faster and Easier!

ROK’n Roadways is a whole new way to build with Rokenbok. The new Roadways building pieces are self supporting, requiring many fewer beams and blocks to build a road or bridge. Build the coolest highways, causeways, or suspension bridge. Now you can build bigger, better Rokenbok buildings with a lot fewer pieces! Check out the roadway elements. They use so much less plastic than the ramps and deck plates they replace, and yet they guide your Rokenbok RC vehicles, eliminating the need for guard rails. Your Rokenbok buildings will require fewer pieces to build, and seeing inside to guide your vehicles along is easier and more fun. And younger Rokenbokers will find a lot more driving success too.

All Rokenbok vehicles are now manufactured with a new battery door that is part of the ROK’n Roadways vehicle guide system. You will find two of these special battery doors included in each ROK’n Roadways for your older Rokenbok vehicles.

## Common Questions
Q- How do ROK'n Roadways help guide vehicles around curves?

A- The center ridge on curved roadways engages a guide on the vehicles' battery door.

Q- What is the yellow building piece at the end of the bridge in the picture?

A- We call that a Super Slide.  It lets vehicles slide quickly and safely.
