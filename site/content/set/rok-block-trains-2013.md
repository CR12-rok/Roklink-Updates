Trains

All aboard and full steam ahead! This set features two different trains; build a Steam Engine or a Circus Train. Both are sure to bring your little engineer hours of playtime. Your children will have lots of fun building and creating while developing their hand-eye coordination and learning mathematical correspondences. Quick, load some freight and letâ€™s get rolling! You can add more ROK Blocks to make even bigger trains and haul more cargo.

Your Trains set comes with building plans to build either a Steam Engine or a Circus Train. Plus, storage is made simple with the included durable clear plastic storage bin for easy clean-up.

ROK Blocks are designed to teach children how to assemble their own creations, keeping kids busy for hours with creative fun.  Plus, all ROK Blocks are compatible with Rokenbok building pieces so this is only the beginning! The adventure continues as you expand sets and open up new possibilities.

Key Concepts:

Children learn mathematical correspondences, how to re-purpose material, using simple machines, and different ways blocks can connect.  This develops underlying affinities for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math).

Bonus:  This ROK Block sets come with The ROK Blocks Big Idea Book. This action packed book includes the step-by-step instructions to build both the Steam Engine and the Circus Train,  plus over 20 awesome detailed plans for ROK Block creations* (additional parts required). The Big Idea Book is also filled with tips on how to promote learning, creativity, and school readiness skills.

## Common Questions
Q- Are ROK Blocks like DUPLO blocks?    
A- Both ROK Blocks and DUPLO are preschool blocks, but the similarity ends there. Unlike DUPLO, ROK Blocks are three dimensional interlocking blocks that can be stacked up and out. They can be combined in thousands more combinations than two dimensional blocks like DUPLO, and are much more easily made into functional toys like airplanes and helicopters, cars and trucks, etc.

Q- Is it easy to combine ROK Blocks with regular Rokenbok building blocks sets?    
A- Yes, very easy and intuitive. ROK Blocks add a new dimension to Rokenbok construction that even advanced Rokenbokers enjoy and appreciate. ROK Blocks are a great addition to any Rokenbok building collection.
