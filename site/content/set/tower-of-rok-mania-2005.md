title: Tower of Rok Mania
year: 2005
description: >-
  Maybe the coolest and most amazing Rokenbok building ever! To start the action, the included Power ROK Lift carries blue and red ROKs up this five story tower. Watch as the ROKs go spinning down Dual Spirals, in opposite directions! Double Tipples complete the ROK’s journey, dumping them into twin Giant ROK Silos that can hold 400 ROKs or more! Fun to build and even more fun to operate, the Tower of ROK Mania is the best place to give your RC Loader and RC Fork Lift a work out, and to store every one of your Rokenbok ROKs.

  Includes: Motorized ROK Lift with Dual Dumping Bins, 16” Double Spiraling Chute System, 2 Giant ROK Tipples, Blue and Red ROK Auto-feeding Storage Silos, 458 Snap-fit Building Pieces. Requires 3 AA batteries, not included.
