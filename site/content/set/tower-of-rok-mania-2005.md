## Common Questions
Q- Is this the same ROK Lift that is sold separately?

A- Yes, it is the same ROK Lift machine, but this one comes with two crate platforms and more gear tracks to make a taller tower.

Q- This looks like a lot of fun; would it be appropriate for a five-year-old?

A- Yes and no.  The Tower of ROK Mania would be fun for a younger child to operate, but it is a challenging build plan, especially the spacing of the curves in the dual spiral.
