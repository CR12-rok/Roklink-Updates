year: 2002
description: >-
  Scoops, Transports & Dumps Balls!
  When you've got to move a mountain of ROKs (balls) fast, this is your workhorse. Scoop a bucket-load of ROKs and lift them in to the bed. When your bed's full, drive to your destination and then dump the load. Works ideally with the Motorized Conveyor and Power ROK-Lift. Having more than one of these on the job makes short work of any project. Requires a Start Set and three AA batteries (not included).
