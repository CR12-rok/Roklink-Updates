Monorail Mania Complete Action Set Launch your Rokenbok world with the exciting, futuristic Monorail Mania Complete Action Set! This modern twist on a beloved classic brings a whole new level of fun to your family. Your little engineer will delight in taking control of the Monorail's power dump bed that moves from side to side for easy loading and unloading action. Haul and dump your payload of ROK Balls onto the automatic conveyor and watch as the balls are automatically lifted on the conveyor belt. You'll be amazed as they are then sorted by size and color before being stored in spring-loaded dumping bins to await your next pick up. 

The dynamic Monorail Mania Complete Action Set can either serve as a starting point for your new Rokenbok world or can be an awesome addition to your existing Rokenbok collection. This set comes with nearly 8 feet of track assembled from standard Rokenbok building pieces making it easy to expand and add switches and crossings too!

Rokenbok's Monorail Mania Complete Action Set includes: Monorail with Power Dump Bed, ROK Star Controller, Automatic Conveyor, Monorail Crossing, Sorting Chute System, Two Loading Docks, Detailed Plan Sheet with building instructions and over 77 building pieces.
