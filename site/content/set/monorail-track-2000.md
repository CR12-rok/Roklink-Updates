Add this to your Monorail Start Set and design simple circles, ovals, figure-eights or tracks that go up and down and around. Create your own layouts or use those provided in the enclosed plan book. For existing Rokenbok Pump Station, Power Chutes or Action Factory Start Set owners, this building set provides an economical entry into the Rokenbok Rail System when combined with new RC Monorail Freighter. This 136-piece set includes risers to support track, catwalks, signal lights, worker and man lift.
