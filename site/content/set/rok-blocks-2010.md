A better block.  We thought long and hard about how to make a better building block for younger construction builders. We concluded that a better block had to be really easy to use, build fun models, and be fun for parents too.

Young children's hands are not very strong or well coordinated, so a really good interlocking block has to be self aligning.  Get two ROK Blocks even close together, and their funny shaped cones guide them into alignment.  A little squeeze, and the blocks snap together.  A stacking block won’t hold a child’s attention for long if they can’t make something fun to play with.  ROK Blocks are made in a unique, patent pending way that allows them to stack Small Parts Iconboth up and out in three dimensions. They assemble in thousands more combinations than traditional blocks.  This makes it easy to build fun models like trucks, cars, houses, planes and helicopters.  ROK Blocks are compatible with all other Rokenbok sets and can be used in your child’s most advanced Rokenbok creation ten years from now.
