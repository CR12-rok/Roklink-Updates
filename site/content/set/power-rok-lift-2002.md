  - Hoists your cargo up its track to the top, where ROKs are automatically unloaded.
  - ROKs spill into a hopper, roll through the zigzag chute system and into the giant ROK Tipple.

  - Flexible, simple conveyor system is a valuable addition to any Rokenbok World.

The ROK-Lift is a vertical conveyor that can lift a crate of cargo to any height.  With a simple bump of your vehicle, the ROK-Lift will hoist your cargo up its track to the top, where your ROK cargo is automatically unloaded.  ROKs spill into a hopper and then roll and tumble through the zig-zag chute system and into the giant ROK Tipple at the bottom.  Place a crate on the ROK-Liftâ€™s platform with your Fork Lift, or fill the crate with your Loader or Dump truck.  Add more gear tracks (sold separately) to make the ROK-Lift go even higher!

The ROK-Lift is the perfect machine to feed Rokenbok chute systems and move ROKs through your Rokenbok World.  Because the ROK-Lift travels straight up a slim tower of beams and gear tracks, it can be placed almost anywhere.  The crate platform can be snapped on either the left or right side of the lift.  This flexible, simple toy conveyor Small Parts Iconsystem is a valuable addition to any Rokenbok world.

Requires 3 AA batteries (not included).

## Common Questions
Q- How does the ROK-Lift know when to start?    
A- The ROK-Lift has a switch on the front. Just bump it with any vehicle, and it will automatically travel to the top, dump its load of cargo, and return to the bottom ready to pick-up another load.

Q- Is the ROK-Lift controlled by the ROK-Star Controller?    
A- Not directly; but use the ROK Star Controller to command any Rokenbok machine, even the Monorail, to bump the ROK-Lift's switch and start it on its way.
