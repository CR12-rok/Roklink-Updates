Transport Your RC Vehicles Up & Down!
You've never seen anything like it! Take your Vehicles to dizzying heights by using standard Beams and Blocks to create an elevator shaft in your Rokenbok World. Then use your Control Pad to raise and lower your vehicles from one floor to the next. You can even use the enclosed Monorail Track adapter to convert your Rokenbok RC Elevator into a monorail transport! Combine with other building sets to build an elevator shaft up to four floors high (one floor shown). Works with Control Pad and radio key. Transports all Rokenbok Vehicles plus the new RC Monorail Freighter. Includes 61 pieces. Requires four AA batteries.
