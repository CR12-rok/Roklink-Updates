Expand Your Monorail System!

Love your Monorail and want to expand the adventure? This wonderful add-on track and construction set expands your track layout and adds a storage depot, loading dock, monorail switch track, and monorail crossing!

Monorail Storage Depot is the perfect companion to the Monorail Mania Complete Action Set.

Fun Features

Loading Dock: Drive up onto the Loading Dock with your Dump Truck, Power Sweeper, Loader, or Skip Track vehicles to load the Monorail.

Storage Depot: Glide your Monorail into the storage depot to unload ROKs into the red and blue bins. The Rokenbok Forklift is the perfect companion in this area!

Monorail Switch: Quick, there's a new delivery in the unloading zone! Throw the monorail switch to change tracks and get there ASAP. This fun monorail accessory is great for designing new, creative track layouts.

Rail Crossing: There's no time for delays, so drive any vehicle through the rail crossing before the Monorail comes through at full speed!

Hop onto this great new build and start a new adventure with your little engineer today! The Monorail Storage Depot is the perfect way to play!

Note: Vehicles not included.
