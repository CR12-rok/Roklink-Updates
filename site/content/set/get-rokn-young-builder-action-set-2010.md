Get ROK’n is a young builder’s introduction to Rokenbok remote control interaction.  This set combines the full function remote control Dump Truck with our revolutionary ROK Blocks, and a Motorized Conveyor with chutes and loading docks for sorting and delivery.  All the action is controlled by the ROK Star Controller.

This Dump Truck loads from the front or rear, so head straight into a loading dock for a load of red or blue ROKs.  Dump your load of  ROK balls into the Motorized Conveyor and watch it come to life, automatically.  ROKS are lifted into a chute system where they are sorted and stored in the dispensing loading docks, all ready for the next pick-up!  Get ROK’n is specifically designed for preschool play with the ability to add more Rokenbok remote controlled machines and building sets as your child grows.

What has two microprocessors, multiple gear trains, three motors, and safety clutches?  The Rokenbok Dump Truck, of course!  Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills. This is not an ordinary toy dump truck, but a precise and rugged ROK Star controlled robot.  ROK Star machines are smart too. They won’t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.
