description: >-
  The first Rokenbok purchase for every family must be a starter set. Either the Basic Start Set (Power Chutes) or the Deluxe Start Set (Action Factory). Each starter set contains everything you need to start playing: the command deck, a control pad, a remote-controlled vehicle and a selection of components and accessories. The Command Deck can only be purchased with a Start Set. After purchasing a starter kit, you can expand your Rokenbok system however you like.
