The X2 is an all new ROK Star machine dedicated to powering Rokenboker invented machines.  Power-up and control elevators, draw bridges, cranes, thrill rides, tramways, and more - all with your ROK Star Controller (not included).  The X2’s two independent motors power three drive types; winch drive, cog drive, and axle drive.

Create powerful lifting machines with the winch drive and a multi-part pulley system. Use the cog-drive to move the X2 along in your gantry crane. Design a powerful tractor and power it with the X2’s axle drive.  Or build a tram to fly above your Rokenbok world.  Snap the X2 anywhere into a Rokenbok world and see what’s possible.  In the hands of an advanced Rokenboker, there’s no limit to what can be invented and operated. This set comes with an assortment of pulleys, axles, hinges, angle connectors as well as building instructions to build a gantry crane. Plus, you will find all of the parts needed to construct the draw bridge featured above.

What has two microprocessors,  two independent clutched gear trains, and a threadable cable?  The X2 Power Unit, of course!   ”ROKIt’s not an ordinary RC toy, but a precise and rugged ROK Star controlled robot.  ROK Star machines are smart too.  They won’t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires ROK Star Controller and 3 AA batteries (not included).

## Common Questions
Q- Is the remote controller included?
A- No, A ROK Star Controller is required, but not included. You can find the ROK Star Controller in the ROK Works and Get ROK'n action sets, the Power Sweeper Value Pack, and sold separately.

Q: Is the X2 powerful enough to lift another Rokenbok vehicle?
A: Yes, you can even lift multiple vehicles by combining the winch drive with pulley systems to build powerful elevators and lifts.

Q: What can the cog drive do?
A: Snap the X2 into place, and the cog drive pushes and pulls Rokenbok Beams to create linear drive systems. Or, place the X2 onto gantries constructed of Rokenbok beams, and use the cog drive to drive the X2 forward and back along the gantry.

Q: What do you mean by an axle drive?
A: Snap a beam into the end of cog drive, and you’ve got a powered axle. Use it to spin the drive wheel on a giant tramway or the wheels of your own custom Rokenbok vehicle.
