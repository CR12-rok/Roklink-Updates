The new Inventor’s Kit, with 161 building pieces, is perfect for the avid Rokenbok expert to extend the fun and play of any existing set, because for the first time, Rokenbok is introducing special-use, custom blocks into the system. The Inventor’s Kit is a collection of new blocks that revolutionizes the capabilities of the entire Rokenbok system by enabling builders to improvise with drawbridges, block-and-tackle, elevators, custom trailers, treadmills and diagonal construction using 30-degree angles, 60-degree angles, pulleys, hinges, swivel blocks, tow hooks, wheels and axles, and single snap blocks. Add the new Inventor’s Kit to your existing Rokenbok collection and take your next construction project to a whole new level!

Quick Facts:
  - An advanced building set for creating your own Rokenbok machines.
161 pieces: angle blocks, pulleys, hinges, swivels, tow hooks, wheels and axles, and more.
  - Perfect companion for the X2 Dual Drive Power Unit.
  - Modular, works with all Rokenbok machines and engineering sets.

Want to design and engineer your own drawbridge?  How about a block-and-tackle lift to raise those heavy loads?  Special angles for that barn roof you've had in mind?  Or a custom trailer?  A ski lift?  The NASA Crawler?  The Inventor’s series building components open-up a world of engineering possibilities.

The Inventor’s Kit, with 161 building pieces, is perfect for advanced Rokenbok engineers to extend the fun and play of any existing set. This collection of building components enables expert builders to improvise with diagonal construction using 30 and 60 degree angle blocks, and to make articulating  machines with pulleys, hinges, swivel blocks, tow hooks, wheels and axles, and more.

Don't forget, you can add the X2 Dual Drive Power Unit to power your engineering inventions.  With winch, axle, and cog drives, the X2 will inspire you to create even more inventions with your Inventor’s Tool Kit.

Common Questions
Q- What makes this an advanced building set?

A- Most Rokenbok building sets are carefully designed to keep young builders 'on grid', helping them to follow plans or invent their own buildings.  When we introduce building components like angle pieces and multi-part pulleys, it takes more experience to complete builds successfully.
