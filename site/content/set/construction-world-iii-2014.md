Our Ultimate Action-Packed Construction Set!

Max out your Rokenbok adventure with this giant building set and build the Grand Central Station or Rokenbok Suspension Bridge. Make the largest buildings ever! With 485 building pieces, this set includes roadways, chutes, railway tracks, and cool architectural elements.

Drive your Monorail through the twists and turns under Grand Central Station and power up your vehicles to operate the chutes! Dump your ROK balls and watch the chute system sort them all out! Then head over later for a pick up.

After Grand Central Station, take to the streets with the Construction World III Suspension Bridge. Using real engineering principles, the Suspension Bridge stretches an astonishing 6 feet! Avoid a traffic jam in ROK city and divert traffic ASAP.

Whether you are weaving your way through the Grand Central Station's monorail tracks or parading across the Suspension Bridge, both builds are guaranteed to be full of fun and learning!

Construction World III builds:

Grand Central Station

  - Includes underground, X-crossing monorail tracks.
  - Raised dual-lane roadway.
  - Chute system for sorting your ROK balls.

Suspension Bridge

  - Over 2.5 ft. tall and 6 ft. long!
  - Uses thick suspension cables that tie the road and tower together.
  - Kids are amazed to see engineering principles of bridge suspension at work.

*Vehicles not included.
