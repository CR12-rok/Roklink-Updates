Make your rail system bigger & better!
Build this awesome storage depot and freight yard. This is an excellent addition for your RC Monorail Freighter. You get a mountain of 180 pieces to expand your Monorail set. What are you waiting for? There's a big job to do! Use your RC Loader to load the RC Monorail at the freight dock siding. Now glide your Monorail through the switch so you can fill the 4 individual cargo containers. Your RC Forklift can pick up each storage container and deliver them to other areas in your site. Itâ€™s a lot to do, endless multi-fun. ROK Worlds ROK!

Includes 4 Storage Racks, 4 Storage Bins, 1 Switch, 1 Crossing, 2 Decorative Signs, over 180 pieces!
