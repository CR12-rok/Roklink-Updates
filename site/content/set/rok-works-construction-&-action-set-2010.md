Designed to be a home base, this construction set for kids is the best starting point for anyone looking to create a dynamic, expandable Rokenbok world. ROK Works includes a broad selection of Rokenbok building pieces. The Monorail, Forklift, and ROK Lift are especially easy to add when you’re ready to expand your Rokenbok world.

What has two microprocessors, three motors, working headlights and four-wheel drive? The Rokenbok Loader, of course! Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills. This is not an ordinary remote control toy, but a precise and very rugged Small Parts IconROK Star controlled robot. ROK Star machines are smart too. They won’t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires 9 AA batteries (not included).
