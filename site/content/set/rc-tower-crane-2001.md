Move Up, Over & Around a 360° Radius!
Build the RC Tower Crane into your Rokenbok World by simply snapping the base of the Crane into standard Rokenbok beams and blocks! Moves large payloads up, over and around a 360° radius.

Includes four amazingly versatile crane arm attachments: An oversized Bucket for carrying and dumping loads of Rokenbok balls. A Cargo Hook for moving beams and blocks. A Platform for elevating Rokenbok workers and freight. And a large Claw for grabbing beams, blocks, balls, and other Rokenbok material. Requires 3 AA batteries.
