##Common Questions
Q- What makes this an advanced building set?    
A- Most Rokenbok building sets are carefully designed to keep young builders 'on grid', helping them to follow plans or invent their own buildings.  When we introduce building components like angle pieces and multi-part pulleys, it takes more experience to complete builds successfully.
