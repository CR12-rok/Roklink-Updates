Meet the Rokenbok Maker ROK-Bot. It is a versatile, mobile building platform that makes building robots and mechanical systems easy, fun, and educational. The Maker ROK-Bot is fully compatible with every element in the Rokenbok engineering system. That means there are thousands of different robots waiting for kids to design and build. The Maker ROK Robotics Set includes step-by-step plans to create five different construction vehicles and is controlled by the included ROK Star Controller.

You can build the following:

Front-End Loader
Gripper
Dump Truck
Dozer
Forklift
These robots interact with all your existing Rokenbok machines and are compatible with Rokenbok buildings and roadways. Completing these builds will give young minds insight into the mechanics of robotics, teaching them about design and engineering while they have fun with motors, mechanisms, and linkages. After building different designs, young makers will have the experience to create whatever they can imagine.
