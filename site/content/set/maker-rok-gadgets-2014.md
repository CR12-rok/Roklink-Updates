Creates 3 ROK-tastic Builds

Maker ROK Gadgets will challenge kids to think about the way simple machines function through 3 hands-on builds: the ROK-A-Pult, ROK Racer, or ROK Grabber. Hands-on play is a great way to foster learning and give children a deeper understanding of the world around them.

This is a great opportunity to teach kids about potential energy, as well as introduce angles and measuring. Maker ROK Gadgets is the first of our brand new Maker Series - Supporting STEM Education.
