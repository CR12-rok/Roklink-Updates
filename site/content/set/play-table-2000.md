year: 2000
description: >-
  A handcrafted table designed specifically for the Rokenbok System. The rugged tabletop border, constructed of Rokenbok building pieces, will allow you to extend off the table's surface by cantilevering monorail tracks or roadways. And, by using the border in tandem with the new RC Elevator, you can even build all the way to the floor! And now, two or more tables fit neatly side-by-side for even more playing area! The Rokenbok Play Table is about four feet long by three feet wide, with an adjustable height of 22 to 30 inches. Includes carpet playing surface. Command Deck mounts securely. 185 building pieces included. Dimensions: 47.10 (l) x 36.10 (w)
