Mega-saurus Jumbo Set

ROAR! Unleash your imagination and travel back in time when dinosaur walked the earth. The Mega-saurus Jumbo Set is an advanced ROK Blocks set for every dinosaur loving child. You and your child can explore the world of dinosaurs by building two of history's most famous dinosaurs. Start off with building the peaceful Triceratops with his bony frill, three facial horns, wagging tail and hoofed feet. Talk about how this leaf eater was a peaceful giant wandering the jungle in search of his next meal.  When your done transform him into infamous T-Rex, the largest of the meat-eating dinos that walked our earth. This T-Rex stands over 17" tall, features ferocious jaws that actually move with the use of our hinge blocks. This dino is looking to devour what ever stands in his way.

Plus, clean up is simple! All parts can be stored in the included durable clear storage bin.

ROK Blocks are designed to teach children how to assemble their own creations, keeping kids busy for hours with creative fun. Plus, all ROK Blocks are compatible with Rokenbok building pieces so this is only the beginning! The adventure continues as you expand sets and open up new possibilities.

Key Concepts:

This set demonstrates advanced techniques for creating structural integrity.  Children learn mathematical correspondences, how to re-purpose material, using simple machines, and different ways blocks can connect.  This builds underlying affinities for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math).

Bonus: This ROK Block sets come with The ROK Block Big Idea Book. This action packed book includes the step-by-step instructions to build both the Triceratops and the T-Rex, plus over 20 detailed plans for more ROK Block creations* (additional parts required). The Big Idea Book is filled with tips for parents on how to promote learning, creativity, and school readiness skills.

## Common Questions
Q- Are ROK Blocks like DUPLO blocks?    
A- Both ROK Blocks and DUPLO are preschool blocks, but the similarity ends there. Unlike DUPLO, ROK Blocks are three dimensional interlocking blocks that can be stacked up and out. They can be combined in thousands more combinations than two dimensional blocks like DUPLO, and are much more easily made into functional toys like airplanes and helicopters, cars and trucks, etc.

Q- Is it easy to combine ROK Blocks with regular Rokenbok building blocks sets?    
A- Yes, very easy and intuitive. ROK Blocks add a new dimension to Rokenbok construction that even advanced Rokenbokers enjoy and appreciate. ROK Blocks are a great addition to any Rokenbok building collection.
