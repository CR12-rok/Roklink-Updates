## Common Questions
Q. How old are the students who benefit the most from ROK Block Adventures?    
A. The curriculum was tested with children ages 4-6, but ROK Blocks are designed to be easy to use for even the youngest builders while still holding plenty of challenge for grown-ups! Building with ROK Blocks develops the confidence and persistence required to problem solve. These are important learning habits that must be encouraged from toddlerhood through the early primary grades so that students are motivated to advance through more complex learning tasks throughout their educations.

Q. How many students will a curriculum kit support?    
A. The kit best supports small groups (4-6) of children with an adult mentor and makes an excellent rotation option for your classroom.

Q. Can the toys be used for free block play?    
A. Yes! The play mats and plan sheets are engaging invitations to support building competencies, but ROK Blocks are designed for expression and innovation. You and your students will build amazing new things. We hope you will send us pictures of your designs.

Q. How do building blocks support language development?    
A. As children play with the blocks, play mats and plan sheets they will learn to describe blocks according to their properties. Adult mentors and peers will also invite discussion about plans, designs, and final builds. You may wish to incorporate written personal narration of individual builds to support reading and writing readiness.

Q. How do the toys support the acquisition of STEM skills?    
A. Working with the play mats and plan sheets students will develop fluency with diagrams. They will begin to order objects according to physical properties and quantitative understanding. ROK Block builders develop the habit of thinking analytically as they have fun solving construction design problems.
