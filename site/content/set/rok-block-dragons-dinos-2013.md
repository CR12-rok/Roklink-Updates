Dragons & Dinos

Build your own Dragon and watch him swoop down from the sky and blow fire from his snout! He’s hungry and those ROK balls look mighty tasty! As kids tell stories and hone their verbal skills they will also be improving hand eye coordination and cognitive development through block play. This set combines the fun and imagination of mythical and extinct creatures with functional 3D block play to create a rich educational environment. Children think they are just having fun!

This set comes with building plans to build a Dragon or a Dinosaur. Plus, storage is made simple with the included durable clear plastic storage bin, keeping all your parts together, organized and in good condition.

ROK Blocks are designed to teach children how to assemble their own creations, keeping kids busy for hours with creative fun. Plus, all ROK Blocks are compatible with Rokenbok building pieces so this is only the beginning! The adventure continues as you expand sets and open up new possibilities.

Key Concepts:

Children learn mathematical correspondences, how to re-purpose material, using simple machines, and different ways blocks can connect.  Children develop underlying affinities for STEAM (Science, technology, engineering, arts, and math).

Bonus:  This ROK Block sets come with The ROK Blocks Big Idea Book. This action packed book comes with over 20 awesome build ideas and the step-by-step instructions to build both the Dragon and the Dinosaur, and many more ROK Block creations*(additional parts required). Plus, the idea book is filled with tips for parents on how to promote learning, creativity, and school readiness skills.

##Common Questions
Q- Are ROK Blocks like DUPLO blocks?    
A- Both ROK Blocks and DUPLO are preschool blocks, but the similarity ends there. Unlike DUPLO, ROK Blocks are three dimensional interlocking blocks that can be stacked up and out. They can be combined in thousands more combinations than two dimensional blocks like DUPLO, and are much more easily made into functional toys like airplanes and helicopters, cars and trucks, etc.

Q- Is it easy to combine ROK Blocks with regular Rokenbok building blocks sets?    
A- Yes, very easy and intuitive. ROK Blocks add a new dimension to Rokenbok construction that even advanced Rokenbokers enjoy and appreciate. ROK Blocks are a great addition to any Rokenbok building collection.
