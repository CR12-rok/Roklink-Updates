ROK Works may be the best way to start your Rokenbok world. It has everything you need to build a vibrant, interactive construction site. Put the remote control Loader to work with the included ROK Star Controller. Steer it left and right. Spin it. Back it up. Scoop, haul, and dump. Then dump a load of ROK balls into the Motorized Conveyor and watch it come to life, automatically. ROKs are lifted into a chute system where they are sorted and stored in spring-loaded dumping bins. All ready for the next pick-up!

Designed to be a home base, this construction set for kids is the best starting point for anyone looking to create a dynamic, expandable Rokenbok world. ROK Works includes a broad selection of Rokenbok building pieces. The Monorail, Forklift, and ROK Lift are especially easy to add when you’re ready to expand your Rokenbok world.

What has two microprocessors, three motors, working headlights and four-wheel drive? The Rokenbok Loader, of course! Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills. This is not an ordinary remote control toy, but a precise and very rugged Small Parts IconROK Star controlled robot. ROK Star machines are smart too. They won’t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires 9 AA batteries (not included).
