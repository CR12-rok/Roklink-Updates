  Add a little night life to your construction site!
  Light up your work site! This battery-powered trailer features working spotlights and directional arrows. Perfect for your night crew! You're the foreman in charge of this site. Use the rear directional arrows to direct vehicles, control traffic flow, and set up warning signals. Plus, you can light up your warehouse, garage and construction area and work-until-dawn.

  The Night Shift Trailer remotely hitches to any Rokenbok vehicle so you can take it anywhere in your ROK Works construction zone. Get the Night Shift Trailer because Rokenboker's never sleep! Requires 2 AA batteries.
