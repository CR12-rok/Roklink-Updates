title: Power Chutes II Start Set
year: 2006
description: >-
  The easiest way to get your start in Rokenbok!
  The Power Chutes Start Set includes everything you need to build your own exciting Rokenbok world. The powerful RC Skip Track vehicle works just like a real “front loader,” completely under your control with the Control Pad and new battery-operated Radio Control Center. Build the Power Chutes factory, then scoop up a load of Rokenbok ROK balls using the Skip Track’s powerful track drive and high-lift bucket. Drive up onto the sturdy platform and send your load of ROKs flying down the chute systems. When the job is done, rocket down the Super Slide for another load!

  Expanding Power Chutes is a ‘snap’ – every building piece can be used with every other product in the Rokenbok line. Want to invite more players to join in, or add more RC vehicles? The Radio Control Center can command up to four Control Pads and eight Rokenbok RC Vehicles! The Power Chutes Start Set is an easy and affordable way to slide into the world of Rokenbok. Requires one 9-Volt and three AA batteries, not included.

  Recommended for ages 6 and up.
