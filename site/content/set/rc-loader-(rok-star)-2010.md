Is it a front loader?  A dump truck?  The Remote Control Loader is both!  The Loader may be the hardest working machine in the Rokenbok fleet.  It can load itself, haul loads to any location, and then dump cargo exactly where you want it.

The Loader is carefully designed for maximum utility in the Rokenbok world.  Back into a spring loaded bin box, and the Loader collects ROKs.  Or, pull into a quarry and scoop ROKs over the cab of the Loader to fill the bed to the brim.  Then, raise the dump-bed and fill the crate in a ROK Lift, or dump cargo into a waiting Monorail.  The Loader has four wheel drive, an automatic trailer hitch, working headlights, and an adjustable pitch horn.

What has two microprocessors, three independent gear trains, trim-able steering, and a siren?  The Rokenbok Loader, of course!  Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills. This is not an ordinary RC toy, but a precise and very rugged ROK Star controlled robot.  ROK Star machines are smart too. They wonâ€™t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires ROK Star Controller and 3 AA batteries (not included).
