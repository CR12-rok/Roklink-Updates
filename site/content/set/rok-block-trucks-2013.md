TRUCKS

QUICK! Send out the cherry picker! We need a Rokenbok resucue! Using the specially designed hinge blocks the lift arms can extend up and out at different angles and teach children about the power of simple machines.  Stage your own rescue and when you’re done, rebuild everything as a flatbed tow truck for a whole new adventure. The tow truck even comes with two  vehicles that can drive up and down the tow truck ramp.

This set comes with building plans for both the cherry picker and the tow truck with ROK jeep and car. And, it all comes packed in a clear plastic container for easy clean-up and storage.

ROK Blocks are designed to teach children how to assemble their own creations, keeping kids busy for hours with creative fun. Plus, all ROK Blocks are compatible with Rokenbok building pieces so this is only the beginning! The adventure continues as you expand sets and open up new possibilities.

Key Concepts:

Children learn mathematical correspondences, how to re-purpose material, using simple machines, and different ways blocks can connect.  This develpps underlying affinities for STEAM (science, technology, engineering, arts, and math).

Bonus:  This ROK Block sets come with The ROK Blocks Big Idea Book. This action packed book comes with over 20 awesome build ideas including the step-by-step instructions to build both the Cherry Picker and the Tow Truck, plus many more ROK Block creations*(additional parts required).  The Big Idea Book is also filled with tips on how to promote learning, creativity, and school readiness skills.

##Common Questions
Q- Are ROK Blocks like DUPLO blocks?

A- Both ROK Blocks and DUPLO are preschool blocks, but the similarity ends there. Unlike DUPLO, ROK Blocks are three dimensional interlocking blocks that can be stacked up and out. They can be combined in thousands more combinations than two dimensional blocks like DUPLO, and are much more easily made into functional toys like airplanes and helicopters, cars and trucks, etc.

Q- Is it easy to combine ROK Blocks with regular Rokenbok building blocks sets?

A- Yes, very easy and intuitive. ROK Blocks add a new dimension to Rokenbok construction that even advanced Rokenbokers enjoy and appreciate. ROK Blocks are a great addition to any Rokenbok building collection.
