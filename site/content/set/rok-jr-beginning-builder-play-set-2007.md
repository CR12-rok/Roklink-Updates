Where Animation and Imagination Collide!

ROK Jr.'s Beginning Builder features larger, press-fit blocks and roadway pieces for easy assembly by four and five year olds. Beginning Builder is action-packed fun with driving, loading and unloading capabilities and an all new, fully featured front-loading Dump Truck! To drive it, we created a new wireless infrared controller dedicated only to the ROK Jr. Dump Truck. It offers intuitive, easy-to-master steering and dumping controls and it fits comfortably in one hand.

The Motorized Conveyor joins ROK Jr. with an amazing sensor that automatically activates when loaded by the Dump Truck. It also features a trio of fun, new automatic chutes that magically sort the red and blue ROKs by color and a pair of loading stations to extend the highly versatile and creative play of the ROK Jr. Conveyor.

What better way to introduce four and five year olds to Rokenbok than with ROK Jr? It brings the fun and learning of Rokenbok to the preschooler and because it will never become obsolete Beginning Builder can be added to the Rokenbok System as your child grows. Requires nine AA batteries, not included. Recommended for ages 4 and up.

ROK Jr. Beginning Builder Play Set includes:
- Remote control Dump Truck
- Hand-held controller designed for smaller hands
- Motorized Conveyor
- Blocks, roadway sections, chutes and loading stations
- Two construction figures, Rocky and Junior
- Detailed Plan Sheet with building instructions
- Over 40 sturdy pieces!
