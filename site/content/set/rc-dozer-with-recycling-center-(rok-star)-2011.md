When you're sorting is complete, use your Dozer to push the ROK balls up the loading ramp and into your Conveyor.

With three motors and powerful treads, the Remote Control Dozer is a bruiser, but it has precision and finesse too! Specially engineered hooks on the Dozerâ€™s blade can drag and stack Rokenbok beams.  The Dozer is the perfect machine to keep your construction site organized and ready for action.

The Remote Control Dozer is a precise and tough remote control robot, engineered for years of play.  It's built for rough play, crashes, tumbles, and spills. And ROK Star control means the Small Parts IconDozer is commanded by any ROK Star controller.

Requires ROK Star Controller and 3 AA batteries (not included).
