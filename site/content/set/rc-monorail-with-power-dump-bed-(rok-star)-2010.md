The Monorail is our easiest vehicle to drive, and offers multiple levels of function and challenge for even the most advanced Rokenboker. This unique vehicle glides across a track created from standard Rokenbok building pieces!  Add rail switches and crossings, design a station or depot, or build tall trestles and drive your toy Monorail through multilevel Rokenbok worlds.

The ROK Star Controller (not included) sends the Monorail gliding down the track, and commands the power dump bed to load or dump.  That means the Monorail can interact with water towers, chute systems, and every other machine in the Rokenbok fleet.  This monorail set includes an oval track set and vehicle crossing.

What has two microprocessors, self centering power dump bed, a hidden rail gripping stabilizer, and cruise control?  The Rokenbok Monorail, of course!  Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills.  This is no ordinary toy monorail, but a precise and very rugged ROK Star controlled robot.  ROK Star machines are smart too. They wonâ€™t Small Parts Icon interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires ROK Star Controller and 4 AA batteries (not included).
