  The new ROK Star Skip Track is a rugged front loader, with a high reach bucket and special 'Bump & Dump' action for fast loading and unloading of payloads.

The new ROK Star Skip Track is a rugged front loader, with a high reach bucket and special 'Bump & Dump' action for fast loading and unloading of payloads.   Just like a real Bob Cat, the Skip Track has skid steering and can spin around on its own axis.  Track drive means this tough little machine can climb the steepest hills, crawl over obstacles, and speed through rough terrain.  The Remote Control Skip Track has three independent motors, so you can operate the bucket while the vehicle is in motion.  And, an automatic trailer hitch means your ROK Star Controller can command the the Skip Track to hook up to its trailer.

The new ROK Silo is a high capacity storage system that can hold hundreds of red and blue ROKs.  The silo acts like a 'bird feeder', spilling more ROKs out as you scoop them into the Remote Control Skip Track's bucket.  The silo features our latest Rokenbok building pieces, the small curve beam and curved window.  Add your Automatic Conveyor to the ROK Silo and you'll have an industrial strength ROK storage and processing station!

This great set also includes all the building pieces you need to build a ROK Blocks Trailer with storage crates and racks, and a Garage/Shed to protect your Remote Control Skip Track from the elements.

Like all our Rokenbok vehicles, the Skip Track is not an ordinary RC toy. Our machines are built tough, desigened for kids and their rough play, crashes, and spills.

Requires ROK Star Controller and 3 AA batteries.
