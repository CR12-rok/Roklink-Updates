title: Remote Control Dump Truck (Rok Star)
year: 2010
description: >-
  The Remote Control Dump Truck is especially easy to operate because it loads and dumps from the front.  Effortlessly guide the Dump Truck into a loading dock to pick up cargo, or pull right up to a Conveyor to dump cargo.  Even the most advanced Rokenbokers will want a Dump Truck as part of their Rokenbok world, because of its huge capacity for moving cargo.

The Remote Control Dump Truck is especially easy to operate because it loads and dumps from the front.  Effortlessly guide the Dump Truck into a loading dock to pick up cargo, or pull right up to a Conveyor to dump cargo.  Even the most advanced Rokenbokers will want a Dump Truck as part of their Rokenbok world, because of its huge capacity for moving cargo.  This vehicle has a manual trailer hitch, horn, siren, and back-up warning.  Separate motors drive the wheels on each side of the Dump Truck, so it can spin on its own axis. A third motor powers the dump bed independently and you can raise and lower the bed while the Dump Truck is on the move.

What has two microprocessors, three motors, a safety clutched dump bed, and working headlights?  The Rokenbok Dump Truck, of course!  Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills. This is not an ordinary toy dump truck, but a precise and very rugged ROK Star controlled robot.  ROK Star machines are smart too. They wonâ€™t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires ROK Star Controller and 3 AA batteries (not included).
