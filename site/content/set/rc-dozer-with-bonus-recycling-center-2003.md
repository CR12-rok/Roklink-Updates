year: 2003
description: >-
  Rev up your RC Dozer & head over to your new Recycling Center. Dump your payload into the sorting station, watch as the balls and barrels are automatically separated into their own storage quarries. When you're ready, use your Dozer to push the ROK balls up, over & into a quarry, hopper or another RC Vehicle. Recycle your ROK balls & transport them to multiple sites. It's RC Dozer fun over & over again! Now, that's what we call recycling!
