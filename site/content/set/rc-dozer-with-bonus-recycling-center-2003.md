We've Turned Work Into Play!
Rev up your RC Dozer & head over to your new Recycling Center. Dump your payload into the sorting station, watch as the balls and barrels are automatically separated into their own storage quarries.

It's RC Dozer fun over & over again! Now, that's what we call recycling!

FREE Bonus Recycling Center: Your Recycling Center comes with 20 barrels, 20 balls - over 104 pieces! Requires Start Set and 3 AA batteries.
