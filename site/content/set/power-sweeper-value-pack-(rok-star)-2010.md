The Power Sweeper is Rokenbok’s most popular vehicle.  We added a free ROK Star Controller to make a special Value Pack. . . a great way to start your Rokenbok experience.  Whether this is your first Rokenbok purchase, or your adding a vehicle to a growing Rokenbok world, this Value Pack is a great choice and a great deal too!

The Power Sweeper is an interactive play powerhouse thanks to four separate motors and a multitude of functions. Move it left and right, back and forward, even spin it on its own axis. Then, with the powered roller in the nose, suck up ROKs or pump them out with the touch of a button on the included ROK Star Controller.  Press another button and the Sweeper tank rises into the air so you can pump balls into another vehicle or a Motorized Conveyor. Or, open the tailgate remotely to dump ROKs from the bed. There’s even an automatic trailer hitch, horn, and back-up warning!

What has two microprocessors, multiple gear trains, four motors, and can hold up to 40 ROKs?  The Rokenbok Power Sweeper, of course!  Rokenbok remote control machines are tough, real working equipment.  They are built for rough play, crashes, and spills.  This is not an ordinary toy street sweeper, but a precise and very rugged ROK Star controlled robot.  ROK Star machines Small Parts Iconare smart too. They won’t interfere with each other so that you can add as many ROK Star machines and controllers as you want to your Rokenbok world.

Requires 6 AA batteries (not included).
