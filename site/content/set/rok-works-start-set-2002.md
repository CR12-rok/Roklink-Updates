Grab your hard-hat and go! There's a lot to be done in this action-packed construction site. Everything you need to get started is included with the Start Set. Within minutes, your Start Set is up and you're in charge! Take control of the life-like RC Loader that scoops, hauls and dumps Rokenbok balls into the factory you've just built. Load up the Motorized conveyor and watch it come to life! The Conveyor's "electronic eye" knows when you've dumped your payload and automatically turns on to lift balls to the top where they can be sorted by color and stored in bins awaiting your next pick-up.

This value priced Start Set includes one Control Pad and the Rokenbok Radio Control Center or "brains" of the system, so you need to buy this set before other Rokenbok products. This expandable system is ready to add more players and vehicles (up to 4 players can control 8 RC vehicles at the same time) and integrates with any Rokenbok building set for unlimited building possibilities.

Includes the Radio Control Center, one Control Pad, RC Loader, Motorized Conveyor - 152 pieces total. Requires 3 AA batteries (not included). Fun for ages 6-106. Lifetime warranty on the Radio Control Center and Control Pad. Special value price. ($179.99 if sold separately).
